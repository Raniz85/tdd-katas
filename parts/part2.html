    </p>
    <p>
        Satisfied with your work you quickly return to your other duties.
        After a few minutes, you get a call from your manager requiring your help.
        Apparently your CEO is furious because he didn't win.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discussing with your manager you decide to alter the rules a bit for the next bowling series:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
        <li>If all ten pins are downed on the first roll it is deemed a strike and grants 10 points</li>
        <li>If all ten pins are downed by the second roll it is deemed a spare and grants 5 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With these new rules, let's return to the example and calculate new scores:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-base03 text-base0 p-2 rounded-xl mb-2">
Yattas Del Lana 3 5 3 5 7 2 3 0 10 4 3
Eve Stojbs 3 7 3 3 9 1 6 4 2 3 1 0</pre>
    <p>
        Dividing this up in frames we get:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-base03 text-base0 p-2 rounded-xl mb-2">
Yattas Del Lana | 3 5 | 3 5 | 7 2 | 3 0 | 10  | 4 3
Eve Stojbs      | 3 7 | 3 3 | 9 1 | 6 4 | 2 3 | 1 0</pre>
    <p>
        Summing up the scores according to the new rules you arrive at:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
        <li>Yattas Delana: 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 10 + 10 (Strike) + 4 + 3 = 55
        <li>Eve Stojbs: 3 + 7 + 5 (Spare) + 3 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 5 (Spare) + 6 + 4 + 5 (Spare) + 2 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 57
    </ul>
    <p>
        And according to these rules Eve Stojbs is the winner with 57 points.
    </p>
    <p>
        Satisfied with the rule changes you go back to your other duties.
        It does't take long for the next scorecard to arrive though
        - apparently your CEO called up everyone else and strongarmed them into another round of bowling as soon as he got
        your rule changes.
