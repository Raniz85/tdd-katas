        <i>"Good Job! You're hired!"</i> She says, offering you a handshake.
    </p>
    <p>
        Somewhat stunned, you take her hand and shake it. She apparently doesn't care that much about not winning but
        instead appreciates your handiwork with the code. This seems like a good start.

        As you walk home, you think about your week. You're still a bit overwhelmed by everything, but you managed
        to get fired from one job and then immediately land a new job - at an arguably better company.

    <p>
        You finally get home. It's only Thursday and you was asked to come in to the office on Monday which means
        you've got friday off.

    <p>
        As you think about how you are going to spend your day off, you quickly decide on one thing at least: <i>no bowling!</i>
