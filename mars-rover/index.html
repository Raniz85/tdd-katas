                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to this programming kata.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This kata consists of several parts where you should solve one part before you look at the next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While you <i>could</i> speed through this kata by just implementing the requirements as quickly as possible,
                    the intention of this kata is to practice Test Driven Development and as such you're recommended
                    to think about this as production code and write proper tests for your implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where appropriate, an example will be shown to better explain the problem.
                    These examples are perfect for an initial test case.
                    I do recommend that you write more tests than just based on the example though,
                    the aim, after all, is to drive development by passing tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good luck!<br/>

            This kata is a variant of the <i>Mars Rover</i> kata that can be found in various places around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your task in this kata is to implement the navigation system for a very simple rover that can land on Mars.

                <h2>Simple rover movement</h2>
                <p>
                    Implement a simple rover that can move forwards and backwards on a flat plane.
                    The rover has a position (x, y) and can receive commands 'F' (forward) and 'B' (backward).
                    The rover starts facing north.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Starting at (0, 0), the command "FF" moves the rover to (0, 2).

            <div>
                <h2>Rover rotation</h2>
                <p>
                    The rover can now rotate left and right using commands 'L' (left) and 'R' (right).
                    The rover can face one of four directions: North, East, South, or West.
                    Rotation changes the direction but not the position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Starting at (0, 0) facing North, the command "RFR" turns right (facing East), moves forward to (1, 0), then turns right again (facing South).

                <h2>World wrapping</h2>
                <p>
                    The world now wraps around at the edges. When the rover moves beyond the boundaries of the world,
                    it appears on the opposite side.
                    Assume the world grid is 10x10 units
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Starting at (9, 5) facing East, the command "F" moves the rover to (0, 5).

                <h2>Spherical world</h2>
                <p>
                    The world is now a sphere. East-West wrapping works as before, but North-South movement
                    has the rover "come down on the other side" - e.g. when crossing the north pole, the rover
                    continues in the same direction but appears on the opposite longitude facing south.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Starting at (5, 9) facing North, the command "F" moves the rover to (0, 9) but now facing South.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Repeated commands</h2>
                <p>
                    Instructions can now have numbers in front of them, meaning they should be repeated that many times.
                    For example, "3F" means "FFF" (move forward three times).
                    Numbers can be applied to any command: F, B, L, or R.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Starting at (0, 0) facing North, the command "3F2R" moves forward three times to (0, 3), then rotates right twice to face South.
